He was told as, “Narendra is really a genius” by the William Hastie (principal of General Assembly’s Institution).</p>

<p>He was very enthusiastic towards Hinduism and became very successful in creating new understanding among people about Hinduism both within and outside the country. He became successful in promoting meditation, yoga, and other Indian spiritual way of self-improvement in the West. He was the nationalistic ideal for the people of India.
